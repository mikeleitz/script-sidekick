# This is the manifest file for your Lickety-Script bundle.
# It contains the following types of files.
#
# lickety-script file - This is a script responsible for bootstrapping your
#                       script. It handles the input and validations specified
#                       in the lickety-script tool.
# user script file    - This is the file you will put your processing logic
#                       into. It will call the lickety-script file to get
#                       user input and do validations. Once that completes,
#                       the user script will take control with all variables
#                       validated.
# This manifest       - Lists all files included in the zip bundle.
# readme markdown     - A markdown file with all options and documentation.
# installer script    - The script you run to install all relevant files
#                       to the appropriate ~/.lickety-script directory.
