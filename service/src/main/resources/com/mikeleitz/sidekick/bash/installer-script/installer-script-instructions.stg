# This script is responsible for installing your script into your home
# directory. Lickety-Script establishes a hidden directories in $HOME.
# .lickety-script/              : The root directory
# .lickety-script/scripts/      : Each script has its own subdirectory with
#                                 all its files in it.
# .lickety-script/bin           : has a symlink to each user-script
#
# This installer script will create all directories if they don't already
# exist. It moves all script files to their appropriate position in the
# directory tree above and sets the appropriate permissions.
#
# The installer will *never* overwrite the user-script but will always
# overwrite all other script files. So it's safe to use the lickety-script tool
# to create a second iteration of your script with additional options and
# install that new iteration. It won't overwrite the user-script file.
