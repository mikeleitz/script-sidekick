 * This snippet does two things.
 *  1. If it doesn't already exist, create a common bash function that takes a value and a regex
 *     and returns 0 if there's a match and any other value if the value doesn't match the regex.
 *  2. Create a specific function that validates the specific value (which is an input option to
 *     the script).
